## Overview

Thanks to recent advances in optical imaging techniques, calcium imaging can now record the activities of thousands of neurons simultaneously, through several sessions and over long periods. Neuron registration assumes a vital role in this process, enabling the monitoring of neurons across multiple movies and extended timeframes by aligning their spatial patterns. We introduce a novel technique for cell registration, using a temporal-conditional variational autoencoder (tcVAE) for precise shape modeling. A comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that incorporating shape-related details can significantly enhance the quality of neuron registration.
